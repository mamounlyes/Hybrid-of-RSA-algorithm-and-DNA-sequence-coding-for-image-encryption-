# Hybrid-of-RSA-algorithm-and-DNA-sequence-coding-for-image-encryption-

This repository contains the Images and codes for reproducing the results ontaind in the term paper:


The used images are found in the file named (Images).


### ENCRYPTION AND DYCRYPTION   

Use the code file `RSA-DNA.py
` to ecrypt and dycrpte an image

```bash 
RSA-DNA.py
```
after running the code you will upload an image for encryption.
your encrypted/decrypted files will be automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file

You will get a results like these if you choose image 1

### Histogram 

to obtain the Histogram , run the code 
```bash 
Histogram .py
```
after running the code you will upload an image and the RDB histogram will be automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file

The RGB Histogram of image 1

### Cross correlation 

For obtaining the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal corss corellation value, run the code 

```bash 
VHD-cross correlation.py
```
after running the code you will upload an image and the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal corss corellation values will be shown as follow 

( v h d )

The obtained cross correlation values for each indivisual image are listed below
