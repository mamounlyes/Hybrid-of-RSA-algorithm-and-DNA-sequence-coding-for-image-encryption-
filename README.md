### ENCRYPTION AND DYCRYPTION   

Use the file `images` to ecrypt and dycrpte an `images`

```bash 
RSA-DNA.py
```
after running the code you will upload an image for encryption.
your encrypted/decrypted files will be automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file

### Histogram 

to obtain the Histogram , run the code 
```bash 
Histogram .py
```
after running the code you will upload an image and the RDB histogram automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file


### Cross correlation 

For obtaining the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal corss corellation value, run the code 

```bash 
VHD-cross correlation.py
```
after running the code you will upload an image and the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal corss corellation values will be shown as follow
