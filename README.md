# Hybrid-of-RSA-algorithm-and-DNA-sequence-coding-for-image-encryption-

This repository contains the Images and codes for reproducing the results ontaind in the term paper:

## IMAGES 

The used images are found in the file Images.

## ENCRYPTION AND DYCRYPTION RESULTS  

Use the file `images` to ecrypt and dycrpte an `images`

```bash 
RSA-DNA.py
```
aftr running the code you will upload an image for encryption.
your encrypted/decrypted files will be automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file


## Histogram 

to obtain the Histogram , run the code 
```bash 
Histogram .py
```
aftr running the code you will upload an image and the RDB histogram automatically saved in the directory where you saved the `RSA-DNA.py` file
